          <h2>The Big Ben</h2>
          <p>Located in London, England, the Big Ben is an internationally known landmark. Although this clock tower is known as the Big Ben, its' formal name is the Great Bell of the Great Clock of Westminster.</p>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>The tower was built in 1859 and was designed by Augustus Pugin in the neo-Gothic architectural style. One of Pugin's last designs, the tower stands 316 feet tall, with each side measuring at 40 feet wide. In 2012, the tower was renamed from the Great Tower to the Elizabeth Tower in honor of Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee. </p>
